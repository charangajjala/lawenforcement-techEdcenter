Agencies first accessed these professionals through federal grants and fusion centers, but the demand for intelligence analysis has outpaced capacity in many areas.  To better support law enforcement’s needs, POLICE TECHNICAL began providing training in analytical techniques.  These original training courses created the foundation of the national AAI Certification offered today."
